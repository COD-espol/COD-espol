# Advancing Camouflaged Object Detection with a Cost-Effective Cross-Spectral Vision System (ACODCS)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the **Advancing Camouflaged Object Detection with a Cost-Effective Cross-Spectral Vision System (ACODCS)** project. The goal is to improve the detection of camouflaged objects in outdoor scenarios by leveraging **high-resolution visible (HR VIS) images** and **low-resolution infrared (LR IR) images**. The project focuses on designing **novel deep learning architectures** that effectively exploit cross-spectral information to mitigate the camouflage effect.

## Objectives

1. **Dataset Generation**: Collect and annotate multispectral datasets in different environments (urban, forest, and aerial).
2. **Cross-Spectral Object Detection**: Develop a framework where each spectral band is processed independently while using information from the other as guidance.
3. **End-to-End Model Development**: Design deep learning models that integrate **information fusion and camouflaged object detection** modules.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the proposed approaches against traditional RGB-based detection methods.

## Project Structure

This repository will contain multiple sub-projects, each implementing or evaluating a different **Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique** for camouflaged object detection. The techniques explored will include:

- **Supervised Learning**: Training models using labeled multispectral datasets.
- **Unsupervised & Self-Supervised Learning**: Exploring alternative learning approaches for improved generalization.
- **Cross-Spectral Image Processing**: Enhancing image registration, edge detection, and guided super-resolution.
- **Fusion-Based Object Detection**: Developing and evaluating deep learning architectures that merge information from multiple spectral bands.

## Implementation

- **Data Collection & Annotation**: Using tools like [CVAT](https://www.cvat.ai) for dataset labeling.
- **State-of-the-Art Methods Evaluation**: Implementing and testing baseline models such as:
  - **SISNet (Search Identification Network - SINet)**
  - **Implicit Motion Handling for Video Camouflaged Object Detection**
- **Neural Network Architectures**: Designing custom deep learning pipelines for **cross-spectral object detection**.

## Funding & Collaboration

This project is funded by the **USA Air Force Office of Scientific Research** and involves collaboration with **ESPOL, CIDIS, and international research institutions**.
